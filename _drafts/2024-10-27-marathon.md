In the summer of 2023 I began running more regularly than usual. I've always been someone that runs at least a couple times a week, but I never really enjoyed it. I figured that if I wanted to run faster and better, I better learn how to start enjoying running. So I did, and by the end of the Fall, I was running most mornings every day. I wasn't running for speed or time; just for enjoyment.

As long as I was going to be running frequently, I figured it would be fun to sign up for a race that would push me a bit. I signed up for the 2024 Marine Corps Marathon, and 



graph ideas:

- line graph with average pace by week
- training runs's pace 

Here are some ideas for Plotly graphs that can help you analyze your running training data:

1. **Scatter Plot of Distance vs. Time**:
   - Visualize the relationship between distance and time for each run. You can add a trend line to see if there's a general pattern in your pacing.

2. **Line Graph of Pace Over Time**:
   - Plot your average pace (time per mile/km) over the course of your training. This can help you track improvements in speed.

3. **Histogram of Distances**:
   - Show the distribution of distances run over a specified time period. This helps identify common training distances.

4. **Box Plot of Pace by Distance**:
   - Compare the pace across different distance categories (e.g., short runs, medium runs, long runs). This can highlight how your pace changes with distance.

5. **Cumulative Distance vs. Time**:
   - Create a cumulative plot showing total distance run over time. This can help visualize your training volume and consistency.

6. **Heatmap of Weekly Mileage**:
   - If you have data over multiple weeks, visualize the total mileage per week using a heatmap. This can help identify peaks and valleys in training volume.

7. **Bar Chart of Average Pace by Month**:
   - Display your average pace for each month to assess seasonal changes and improvements over time.

8. **Pie Chart of Running Locations**:
   - If you have data on where you run, visualize the proportion of runs by location (e.g., park, track, street) to see where you train most often.

9. **Rolling Average of Pace**:
   - Calculate and plot a rolling average of your pace over a specified number of runs to smooth out short-term fluctuations and reveal long-term trends.

10. **2D Density Plot of Pace and Distance**:
    - Use a density plot to show where your runs cluster in terms of pace and distance, providing insights into your training habits.

11. **Box Plot of Heart Rate by Distance** (if available):
    - If you track heart rate, visualize how it varies with different distances to understand effort levels during runs.

12. **Time Series Analysis**:
    - Create time series plots for different metrics (e.g., distance, pace, heart rate) to assess trends over time.

13. **Radar Chart for Training Metrics**:
    - Visualize multiple metrics (e.g., distance, average pace, elevation gain) on a radar chart to compare different aspects of your training.

Each of these visualizations can provide unique insights and help you track your progress over time!
