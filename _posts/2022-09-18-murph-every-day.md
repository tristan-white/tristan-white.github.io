The [Murph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_P._Murphy#Murph_workout) Workout:
<br/>(all completed with a 20 lb weighted vest)
- 1 Mile Run
- 100 pull ups
- 200 push ups
- 300 squats
- 1 Mile Run

One day last year I decided to do a murph (without the vest) and I hated it. A friend showed me a [video of a guy on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@jimbobroski4884/videos) who did a murph every day for a year. I really admired the idea, but knew I couldn't do something like that. At that point, I had only done one murph with a weighted vest in my life, and it killed me and took me over an hour. So I never entertained the thought of doing any kind of consecutive day full-murph challenge.

But last summer I started doing some murphs everyday without the vest. After doing that for a bit, I started doing one every so often with a vest\*. And then I said, why not try to do this for 30 days? Decided to post my progress here to keep myself accountable. I didn't end up hitting a murph every single day, but I'm happy with my progress.

|0|29SEP22|45:16|Day 1 complete. First full murph in a couple weeks because I've been moving around, but now I'm finally in my new place with a pull up bar and a good 1-mile running route. We'll see how long this motivation lasts.|
|1|30SEP22|00:47:16|First rain murph! Harder to get myself to begin the murph today, but that's probably because there was a potluck at work today so I had a huge lunch. I don't normally regret eating a large amount of food, but I also don't normally do a murph after a big lunch, so I'll have to restrain myself in the future.|
|2|01OCT22|50:18|I should have done the murph this morning, but once again I thought nah I'll just do it later, and once again I found that the longer I waited the better I got at making exuses not to do it. I was alos trying not to eat much until I did the murph which ensured my stomach didn't hurt but I felt low in energy. Overall it went well though. About 3/4 through, my sister called and I momentarily forgot that I was in the middle of a timed murph so I lost a few minutes there.
|3|03OCT22|X|On this day I was planning on doing a murph in the morning since I knew I wouldn't have time later in the day. But the night before a close friend called about something very important and ended up talking for hours until past midnight, so since I was so tired my motivation to wake up the next morning was gone. First missed day. |
|4|04OCT22|~|Today there was freezing rain coming down so I only did the non-running parts of a murph. I need to figure out what to do when mother nature won't let me do the murph. Currently brainstorming alternatives to running that would still keep the murph hard.|

|7|07OCT22|00:35:50| Blew my PR out of the water. Honestly I'm not sure why this one went so much better. I did start this one around 2pm which is a few hours earlier than I normally do it. I've been getting close to doing a sub 40 minute murph but I didn't expect to get sub 36 minutes for a long time. Now that I know I can do it I'm hoping to consistently get below 40 minutes.
|8|08OCT22|X|Spent day in cville, didn't find a time to murph.|
|9|09OCT22|X|Didn't plan well and couldn't find time to murph today. Spent the day in Cville, went to  church, spent time with sister, drove home, then had dinner with parents right after arriving.|
|10|10OCT22|~|Did the whole murph except for the run at the end - I ran out of time because people were starting to come over to the house for an event. I was annoyed at myself for not starting a bit earlier so that I would have had time to finish. I really want to work on cutting down time between having the thought "I should start my murph" and actually starting.|
|11|10OCT22|36:47|First day completing a full murph for awhile. I thought I was going a little slower until I saw that it was only 29:00 when I start my last mile. Unfortunately, my last mile went pretty slow so I didn't make a PR, but it was still faster than I thought I was doing.|

|15|14OCT22|42:26||
|16|13OCT22|37:35|Today (Saturday) I started my murph around noon. It was a bit hot but I was still happy with my time. I'm still hapy to be getting anything below 40 minutes - when I started doing muprhs I really didn't think I would be able to do a sub-40 murph for awhile. Also happy because normally I feel pretty unexcited to start doing the murph but today felt good. I just thought - *hey, I need to do that* - and then I did. Times aside, that's what I really want to get from doing these murphs ever day; the ability to make myself do a hard workout without apprehension.|

|25|22OCT22|43:39|Had to take a quick call after the first run which took about three and half minutes.|
|26|23OCT22|43:34|Had to take a quick call for a couple minutes again :\|
|27|24OCT22|39:55||
|28|25OCT22|46:07|This felt like one of my worst murphs and even though I knew it was going to be slow when I started, I was still bummed when I saw I how much slower I completed it than I had recently. But I'm happy that I've been able to get to the point where this is a "bad" time for me - this was about my normal pace in the first week of this month.|
|29|26OCT22||Forgot to record my time again :/|
|30|27OCT22|35:15|PR :)|

*"Official" murphs use a 9kg/20lb vest, though the vest I had was only 8kg.*
