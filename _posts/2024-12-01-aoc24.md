I heard [about Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) last year, but didn't participate because I was busy.

This year I'm still busy, but nonetheless succumbed to the feeling of needing to solve problems simply because they exist. All computer scientists I know have this curse.

The problem: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)

The solution:

```python
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/01/day01.py %}
```
