I heard [about Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) last year, but didn't participate because I was busy.

This year I'm still busy, but nonetheless succumbed to the feeling of needing to solve problems simply because they exist. All computer scientists I know have this curse.

## Day 1

The problem: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)

The solution:

```python
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/01/day01.py %}
```

## Day 2

The problem: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)

The solution:

```python
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/02/day02.py %}
```

## Day 3

The problem: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3)

The solution:

```python
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/03/day03.py %}
```

## Day 4

The problem: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4)

Sample input text: [sample.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tristan-white/tristan-white.github.io/refs/heads/main/_posts/_code/aoc24/04/in2.txt){:target="_blank"}

The solution:

```python
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/04/day04.py %}
```

## Day 5

The problem: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5)

The solution:

```python
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/05/day05.py %}
```

## Day 6

The problem: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6)

The solution:

```python
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/06/day06.py %}
```

## Day 7

After solving [the problem](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/7) today in python, I wondered how much faster it would be in C, so I did both.

| Language | Part 1 Time (sec) | Part 2 Time (sec) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| C | 0.022 | 0.021 |
| Python | 0.471 | 22.463 |


The solution (in Python and C):

```python
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/07/day07.py %}
```

```c
{% include_relative _code/aoc24/07/day07.c %}
```
