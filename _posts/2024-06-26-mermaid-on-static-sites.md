[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) is a neat diagramming and charting tool that lets you render markdown as a graph or chart, making it a great tool for adding graphs to static site generators such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

You can write markdown for mermaid graphs and see them rendered in real time on [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live).

To use it in Jekyll, you have a few options.

### Paste a Few Lines of JS into Your Post

Copy and paste the following html[^1] into your post: 


```markdown
<pre class="mermaid">
graph LR
  a --- b & c --- d
</pre>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10.9.1/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
```

...then replace the mermaid text with your own mermaid text. Your done! The example above renders like this:

```mermaid
graph LR
  a --- b & c --- d
```

### Export Mermaid Graph, then Import into Post

Use [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live) to create a graph, then use their export actions to export to a PNG or SVG. Then you can simply upload the image to your post as you would any other picture.

### Jekyll Plugin
If you really want to use Jekyll to render mermaid markdown using backticks (as you would on GitHub or GitLab), there is a way. It is also much more involved. You need to:

1. Download the [Jekyll Spaceship Plugin](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
2. If using GitHub: [Change your GitHub workflow](https://carsonboden.com/Programming/Jekyll-Pages#github-pages).

Personally, I think method one is easiest, but if you really want to use backticks to denote mermaid graphs, [those](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) [two](https://carsonboden.com/Programming/Jekyll-Pages#github-pages) links will help you do it.
