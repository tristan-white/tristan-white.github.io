[FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/) is a new web framework for creating "modern web applications in pure Python". It's awesome. 

[Railway.com](https://railway.com?referralCode=j8RjDc) is new-ish platform that makes it very simple to deploy any kind of service, including FastHTML. It's awesome.

To help people get started with deploying FastHTML apps to Railway faster, I created a [railway template](https://railway.com/template/TaT_7R?referralCode=j8RjDc) that let's you deploy an app in a single click.

Here's how to use the template.

## Make a Railway Account

You'll need a [railway account](https://railway.com?referralCode=j8RjDc) if you don't already have one (it's free).

You can use your github or email account to create railway account.

## Open the template

If you didn't choose the template in the last step, follow [this link](https://railway.com/template/TaT_7R?referralCode=j8RjDc) or search for "fasthtml quickstart" in the [template marketplace](https://railway.com/templates?referralCode=j8RjDc).

That's it! You're app will deploy automatically.
