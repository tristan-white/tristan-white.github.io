I just learned about [gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), a python library that allows you to quickly build, use, and share machine learning / AI applications. It's probably most well known for being what [Automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) (a GUI for [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-image)) is built upon.

The best part is that you can host your gradio app for [free](https://huggingface.co/pricing) on the website [https://huggingface.co](huggingface.co). Alternatively, you can embed a gradio app on a website by using javascript, but it will take (a long) time to load.

If you have the patience, enjoy my first gradio app that calculates the probably at least two people share a birthday given a group of `n` people. If the math doesn't seem correct, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).

import gradio as gr

def prob(n):
	ret = 1
	for i in range(n):
		ret *= 1 - (i/365)
	return 1 - ret

output = gr.Number(label="Probability a birthday is shared:")

gr.Interface(prob, "slider", output).launch()
</gradio-lite>
