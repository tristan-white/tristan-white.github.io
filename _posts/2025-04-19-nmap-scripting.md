Recently I wanted to extend some of nmap's functionality, so I looked at [nmap's docs](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html) for using the Nmap Scripting Engine.

I love nmap, but its docs aren't the best, and getting started with custom nmap lua scripts wasn't as easy I thought it would be.

I made a quickstart guide for self-reference and for anyone else looking to quickly understand how to write simple nmap scripts; you can find it here:
