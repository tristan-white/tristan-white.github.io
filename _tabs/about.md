I came across a [book](https://youtu.be/vyVpRiqOvt4?t=93) in 2022 that convinced me of the merit of [showing your work](https://youtu.be/vyVpRiqOvt4?t=91). Shortly thereafter, I created this website to document my thoughts so that I (and perhaps others) may benefit from them in the future.

Right now, posts on this site primarily revolve around computer-related topics (since that's where most of my time goes), but I plan on writing about my many other interests as soon as I find the time. Feel free to look around!
