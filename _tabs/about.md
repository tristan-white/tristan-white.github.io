## FAQs
- Why'd you join the Navy?
	- Uncle Sam said he'd pay for my undergrad if I worked for him for five years. It also felt like the logical next step in life; both my parents and grandfathers went to the Naval Academy. I also love to travel, and I'm hoping the Navy will help me do that.

<!--
- Can I hire you?
	- No. Well, not yet. I'm still in the Navy. Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tr15t4n) and I'll let you know when that changes.
