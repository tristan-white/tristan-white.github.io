I'm Tristan, nice to meet you!

I came across a [book](https://youtu.be/vyVpRiqOvt4?t=93) in 2022 that convinced me of the merit of [showing your work](https://youtu.be/vyVpRiqOvt4?t=91). Shortly thereafter, I created this website to document my thoughts so that I (and perhaps others) may benefit from them in the future.

Right now, posts on this site primarily revolve around computer-related topics (since that's where most of my time goes), but I plan on writing about my many other interests as soon as I find the time. Feel free to look around!

## FAQs
- Why'd you join the Navy?
	- Uncle Sam said he'd pay for my undergrad if I worked for him for five years. It also felt like the logical next step in life; both my parents and grandfathers went to the Naval Academy. I also love to travel, and I'm hoping the Navy will help me do that.

- Can I hire you?
	- No. Well, not yet. I'm still in the Navy. Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tr15t4n) and I'll let you know when that changes.
